# Smart Home Manager

This is my passion project for freshman year!
The idea behind this project is to create affordable, but functional ways to automate your home using the power of FDM 3D Printing and the small, but powerful Raspberry Pi Pico along with its RP2040 chip. Implementations are for blind open/closers. 3D designs for this project were created de novo by me.
